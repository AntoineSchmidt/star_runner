# JavaScript game from scratch
I recreated (with some artistic freedom) my favorite flash-game from scratch, using pure JavaScript/JQuery.\
Using the <a href="https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler">jpexs-decompiler</a> to extract assets (images and sounds) from the <a href="media/starrunner.swf">original game</a> (<a href="http://www.bambusratte.com/showgame.php?id=118">online</a>).

For now, only the first level is recreated.\
Levels can be easily edited and added to the game by creating a json file in the levels folder (<a href="docs/levels/">more information</a>).
